# Apple Picker | Project 1
 CS382 Apple Picker By *Justin Schwertmann*

 # Enhancements
 * If in a round greater than the first and have less than the max number of baskets, I thought it would be cool idea to throw baskets from the tree to restore the player to the max number. Unfortunately this ran into issues so I disabled the script on the tree object.
 * Catching a branch (twig) results in the player losing one basket until all basket's are gone resulting in game over.
 * Very rarely will golden apple's fall from the tree, boosting the player's score by 50 instead of the normal 10 of regular apples.
